# Data Science & Generative AI Submissions

This repository contains all notebooks, analyses, and code developed as part of the **Data Science & Generative AI** module. The work demonstrates practical application of data science and artificial intelligence techniques,
with a particular emphasis on data preparation, predictive modelling.

The repository reflects an academic learning portfolio rather than a commercial project.
